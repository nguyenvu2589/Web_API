Purpose
Assignment Four
The purpose of this assignment is to get comfortable working with backend services (or BaaS).
Apigee provides a free backend service with your Apigee Edge account. We will be storing and retrieving data through this service. The backend stores data in JSON snippets and can queried similar to an SQL database. Refer to the resources section for more information regarding the backend service. The starting backend organization is named “Sandbox”, use this one for your backend.
You will then store information about movies and create a proxy with a Node.js server to interact with this service.
Requirements
• Create a collection in Apigee’s BaaS to hold information about movies.
– Each entry should contain the following: Title, year released, and an array of three actors that were in the film.
– The movie collection should have at least five movies. • Create a proxy to interact with the backend service.
– Users should be able to get information about movies through the proxy.
∗ Users should be able to query a specific movie, as well as a list of them.
– Users should be able to post new entries to the BaaS through the proxy.
∗ Ensure incoming entities contain the necessary information. For example, if a movie does not contain actors, the entity should not be created and an error returned to the user.
– Users should be able to delete existing entries from the BaaS through the proxy.
– Follow best practices when creating the proxy, i.e. there should be different paths
based on the collection and operation.
