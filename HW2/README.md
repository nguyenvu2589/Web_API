# Working with NodeJs and Swagger
I did not fully upload node_modules file due to size ( more than 100 files )
Create a Node.js server that accepts requests and creates responses and host it on Apigee.

• If the server accepts a request, it should respond with information about the request.

• The server should have four different URNs that only accept a given HTTP method, while reject the other methods.

– /gets

– /posts

– /puts

– /deletes

– Any requests made to the base URL (no URN specified) should also be rejected.

 Also include some of postman test to prove all requirements have been met.
